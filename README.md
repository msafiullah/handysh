Introduction
============

HandySh (prounced handy sheesh) is a project containing handy UNIX shell scripts.

Initially, these shell scripts were written for my own use. In order to make these scripts work on all UNIX systems, they are written using the Bourne Shell (/bin/sh) scripting language.

Please help to extend the functionalitites and performance of these scripts, add more handy scripts.

Note
====

Scripts with the .sh extention are for testing purposes and are not production ready. They may inflict some serious damage. Use them with caution.

Installation
============

1. Download the source codes into a directory of your choice (e.g. bin)
2. Add this directory to your PATH.
